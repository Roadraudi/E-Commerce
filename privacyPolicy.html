        <p>
            We are pleased that you are interested in our online store. Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Below we inform you in detail about how we
            handle your data.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Access Data and Hosting</h2>
        <p>
            You can visit our websites without providing any personal information. Every time a website is accessed, the web server automatically saves a so-called 
            server log file, which contains, for example, the name of the requested file, your IP address, date and time of the access, transferred data volume, and 
            the requesting provider (access data) and documents the access.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection and Use for Contract Processing and Opening a Customer Account</h2>
        <p>
            We collect personal data when you provide it to us voluntarily as part of your order, when contacting us (e.g., via contact form or email), or when opening
            a customer account. Mandatory fields are marked as such, as we require the data in these cases to process the contract, handle your contact, or open your 
            customer account, and you cannot complete the order and/or account opening or send the contact form without providing this information.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            For contract fulfillment, we share your data with the shipping company responsible for delivery, to the extent necessary for the delivery of ordered goods. 
            Depending on which payment service provider you choose during the ordering process, we transfer the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit 
            institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to the payment service providers commissioned by us, or to the selected payment service. In 
            some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves if you create an account there.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Email Newsletter and Postal Advertising</h2>
        <p>
            If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will use the data required for this or provided by you separately to regularly send you our email newsletter based 
            on your consent.
