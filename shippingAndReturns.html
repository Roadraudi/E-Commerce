        <h3>Returns</h3>
        <p>
            You have 30 calendar days to return an item from the date you received it. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition 
            that you received it. Your item must be in the original packaging.
        </p>

        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>
            Once we receive your item, we will inspect it and notify you that we have received your returned item. We will immediately notify you on the status of your 
            refund after inspecting the item.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your credit card (or original method of payment). You will receive the credit within a certain 
            amount of days, depending on your card issuer's policies.
        </p>

        <h3>Shipping Costs for Returns</h3>
        <p>
            You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the 
            cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.
